# electron-apps [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/electron/electron-apps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/electron/electron-apps)

A collection of apps built on Electron. [electron.atom.io/apps](http://electron.atom.io/apps).

## Adding your App

If you have an Electron application or project you'd like to see added, please
open a pull request! All that's required is a basic YML file and an icon.

### Using the Wizard ðŸ”®

This repository has a CLI wizard much like `npm init` that you can use to generate
a datafile for your app. To use the wizard,
[fork and clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
then run:

```sh
npm install && npm run wizard
```

### Using a Manual Approach ðŸ’ª

Another easy way to add a new app is to copy an existing app and edit its metadata.

To do so, create a new directory in the `apps` directory and include a `.yml`
file and `.png` or `.svg` icon file. The directory can only contain numbers,
lowercase letters, and dashes, and the yml and icon files should be named to
match the parent directory:

```
apps
â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app
    â”œâ”€â”€ my-cool-app.png
    â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app.yml
```

YML file rules:

- `name` is required.
- `description` is required.
- `website` is required, and must be a fully-qualified URL.
- `repository` is optional, but must be a fully-qualified URL if provided.
- `keywords` is optional, but should be an array if provided.
- `license` is optional.
- No fields should be left blank.

Icon file rules:

- Must be a `.png` or `.svg`
- Must be a square
- Must be at least 256px by 256px
